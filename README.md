# Overview of Web Development

## What You Will Learn

In this course, you will learn how to build a fully functional web application from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and PHP. By the end of this course, you will have created a complete web app with the following features:

- **User Authentication**: Create secure login and signup pages for users and staff members.
- **Dashboards**: Develop separate dashboards for users and admins, each with tailored features and functionalities.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for users and content management.
- **Static Pages**: Design and develop essential static pages like Home, About Us, and Contact Us.

This course is structured to provide you with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, guiding you step-by-step through the development process.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

Before starting this course, it is recommended that you have a basic understanding of the following:

- **HTML & CSS**: Familiarity with the structure and styling of web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Basic knowledge of JavaScript for adding interactivity to web pages.
- **PHP**: An introductory understanding of PHP syntax and its role in server-side scripting.
- **SQL**: Basic understanding of SQL for database management.

If you're new to any of these technologies, don't worry! The course will provide brief explanations and resources to help you get up to speed.

## Setting Up Your Environment

To follow along with this course, you’ll need to set up a local development environment. We will use **XAMPP**, a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package, which includes Apache (the web server), MySQL (the database), and PHP.

### Installing XAMPP

1. **Download XAMPP**: Visit the [XAMPP website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and download the version that corresponds to your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   
2. **Install XAMPP**: Run the installer and follow the instructions to set up XAMPP on your machine. Ensure that Apache, MySQL, and PHP are selected during the installation process.

3. **Launch XAMPP**: Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL services. These will serve as your web server and database server, respectively.

### Configuring Your Project in XAMPP

Once XAMPP is installed and running, you’ll need to place your project files in the `htdocs` directory located within your XAMPP installation folder. This directory acts as the root for your local web server.

You will also set up a MySQL database through PHPMyAdmin, which can be accessed via `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in your browser.

## Introduction to GitHub and Version Control

Version control is a crucial part of web development, allowing you to manage changes to your codebase, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of your project. **Git** is the most widely used version control system, and **GitHub** is a platform that allows you to host and manage your Git repositories.

### Why Use GitHub?

- **Collaboration**: Work with other developers by sharing code, tracking changes, and merging contributions.
- **Backup**: Keep your code safe and accessible from anywhere.
- **History**: Track changes over time and revert to previous versions if needed.

### Installing Git and GitHub Desktop

1. **Install Git**: Download and install Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/). Git is the underlying tool that GitHub uses to manage repositories.
   
2. **Install GitHub Desktop**: GitHub Desktop is a user-friendly GUI application that simplifies managing your repositories. Download it from [here](https://desktop.github.com/).

3. **Set Up Your GitHub Account**: If you don't already have one, sign up for a GitHub account at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).

### Using GitHub Desktop

Once you have GitHub Desktop installed, you can clone repositories, make changes, commit those changes, and push them back to GitHub—all through an easy-to-use interface. Here’s a brief overview of how to use it:

1. **Clone a Repository**: Use the `File > Clone Repository` option in GitHub Desktop to clone an existing repository to your local machine.

2. **Make Changes and Commit**: Edit your files locally, then use GitHub Desktop to commit your changes. A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.

3. **Push to GitHub**: After committing your changes, push them to GitHub to update the repository with your latest work.

### Getting the Course Code

The source code for this course will be hosted on GitHub. You can clone the repository to your local machine and follow along with the course materials. All changes you make can be committed and pushed back to your own GitHub repository, allowing you to track your progress and share your work.
